# YouTube-Downloader
a program to download MP4 and MP3 files from YouTube
## important information
getting a python app running as a dmg is a bit complicated so there is still a ton of problems with the apple support, but it does work. Also getting ffmpeg as a path variable takes some time so feel free to use a guide such as this: [ffmpeg path variable guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows)
## Getting Started
go to this site: [ffmpeg download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and download ffmpeg. Then open the terminal and type the following:
```
pip install PyQt5 yt-dlp
```
its very important that you have both the latest version of python as well as PyPi. Assuming you have this you can then open the executable and insert a link from youtube, put in your directory of choice and click MP3 for audio and MP4 for video
